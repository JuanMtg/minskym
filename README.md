Introduction
============
This is a Minsky Machine program editor (also known as the counter machine) made by Juan Antonio MacÃ­as (@JuanMtg).
This program editor tries to emulate the Minsky machine, an abstract machine which is Turing complete, formalized by
Marvin Minsky in 1961.

Machine features
----------------
This machine consists of an infinite sequence of registers, R1,R2,... in which we can store an arbitrary natural number.
A program for the counter machine consists of a finite set of states {S0, S1,...,Sn} such as, for each i, there is an
instruction to be executed by the machine whenever it reaches the state Si. The state S0 is reserved to indicate the
program to stop.

There are two types of instructions:
> 1. Add 1 to the register Rj and proceed to the state Sk.
>    This instruction will be represented as (j, +, k)
> 2. Examine the register Rj. If there is a 0 in it, proceed to state Sl. In other case, subtract 1 and then proceed to
>    the state Sk.
>    This type of instruction is represented as (j, -, k, l)

We will assume that S1 is the initial state of the machine.

Usage of the editor
===================
This editor is coded in Python 3.3.2 and the modules used are the [SciPy](http://scipy.org/) suite to make use of
N-dimensional array functions and the module [tabulate](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tabulate) to properly print some
parts of the program.
